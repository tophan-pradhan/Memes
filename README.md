# Meme Generator

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating memes.

## About

This is a web application that allows users to create memes by adding text to images.
The application is built with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It uses the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to draw the meme text on the image. 
Processing the image and text is done client-side, so no data is sent to any server.
